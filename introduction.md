# Introduction

This annotated bibliography outlines findings in my search for ways to use computer systems to help people. I wanted to get a glimpse into a future where African Americans and Africans _in_ America have built a mechanism to protect themselves from the efforts of those who want to inflict systemic harm. As computer systems and their supporting technologies evolve, the tactics used to perpetuate and reinforce the harm done to vulnerable communities also evolve; therefore, the strategies for fighting for our Liberation must do so at the speed of the Web. Web Technologies allow us to communicate and interact with information in ways that impact decision-making on a global scale within a manner of minutes while affording us the ability to mobilize within Earth days. This work seeks to answer the age-old question, "Where do I start?"
