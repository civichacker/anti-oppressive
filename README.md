# Anti-oppressive Technologies

This repository contains research into Anti-Oppressive technologies, a Theory of Change at Civic Hacker, LLC.

### Abstract

This exposition looks into theories on human behavior, historical examples of technological proliferation, and the social constructs needed to create 'relief from oppression.' We will examine technologies that provide vulnerable communities with competent tools to combat both structural sources of oppression and the oppressive behaviors of elected officials. We can encourage rapid experimentation of community-based solutions to social ails by widening the access to technical know-how. When the masses make efficient use of personal computing devices such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones, it can forge changes in our collective demeanor. The Web can facilitate shared decisions at speeds greater than any legislative body. Furthermore, we acquire gains on developing an ability to 'steer clear' of threats on the collective. Finally, this work readily co-opts the expressiveness of the physical and mathematical sciences in its formulas.
