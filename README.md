# Anti-oppressive Technologies

This repository contains research into Anti-Oppressive technologies, a Theory of Change at Civic Hacker, LLC.

### Abstract

This exposition examines theories on human behavior, how technological proliferation impacts communities, and the social constructs needed to create 'relief from oppression.' By examining software and developing technical skills, critical inquiry serves as a competent tool to combat oppressive systems. Intentional and inclusive design of societal features, such as math fluency and digital access, remains within reach and can encourage rapid experimentation of community-based solutions to social ails. When the masses make efficient use of personal computing devices such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones, it can forge changes in our collective demeanor. The Web can facilitate shared decisions at speeds greater than any legislative body. Furthermore, we acquire gains by developing an ability to 'steer clear' of threats to the collective. Finally, this work readily co-opts the expressiveness of the physical and mathematical sciences in its formulas.
